[0.5+0.5+0.5+1+1.5 = 4 Marks]

a) The OR operator assigns a higher score to documents that contain both terms.
[True/False]
b) The NOT operator can be used to discover all unwanted terms that should be excluded from a
search.
[True/False]
c) Proximity operators are less efficient computationally because the index needs to store
positional information.
[True/False]
d) A crawler gathers documents and sends them to an indexer, which employs the following
modules:
(A) a stemmer;
(B) a language detector to detect the language of each document;
(C) a stop-word eliminator
(D) a filter that detects the format (pdf, Word, etc.) of the document.
Give the correct sequence in which the indexer should apply these modules to a document.
e) Given the following Term Incidence matrix in Table1, list the documents retrieved for the
Boolean query.

Q2. Dictionaries and tolerant retrieval
[0.5+1+3+2 = 6.5 Marks]
a) If I search for term X, and term X has many synonyms, precision is more likely to be a problem
than recall.
[True/False]
b) Name the type of index is suitable for spelling correction.
c) Given the following 3-gram index shown in Table 2 with terms {gram,spam,cram,scram}, and
input query as graam find the correct spelling and the corresponding Jaccard score(Jaccard
score >= 0.5).You will not be graded if you just write the term without writing the Jaccard
score.
am$ -> {gram,spam,cram,scram}
spa -> {spam}
cra -> {cram, scram}
$cr -> {cram}
gra -> {gram}
$gr -> {gram}
pam -> {spam}
$sc
->
ram -> {gram,cram,scram}
{scram}
scr -> {scram}
$sp -> {spam}
Table 2
d) Given the following names Mary and Mira do they result in the same Soundex code and what is
the Soundex code? Given the following convention for replacements.
b, f, p, v → 1

c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z → 2

d, t → 3

l→4

m, n → 5

r→6

Q3. Index construction
[2+2=4 Marks]
a) Consider an index for 1 million documents each having a length of 1,000 words. Say there are
100K distinct terms in total. We do not wish to keep track of term-frequency information. What
is the space requirement for an uncompressed term-document incidence matrix.
b) How would you create the dictionary in blocked sort-based indexing on the fly to avoid an extra
pass through the data?
Q4. Vector space model
[0.5+0.5+3+3=7 Marks]
a) Document vectors vary because different terms receive different weights in different
documents.
[True/False]
b) The vector space model assumes a query and a document can be treated the same (symmetric).
[True/False]
c) Most IR systems are optimized for short queries. Consider a long query of more than 500
words, evaluated by a vector space model ranking IR system. Consider the following commonly
employed optimizations and techniques. Does the technique help process long queries
efficiently? Answer true if it does help, and false if it does not help, and explain your answer
briefly in the space provided as shown in Table 3.
This technique helps long queries?
(i) Postings for each term ordered according to weight, largest weight [True/False]
first
Explain:
(ii) Using an n-gram index
[True/False]
Explain:
Table 3
d) Given a corpus containing 4 documents (A, B, D, E) and a query Q having two terms X and Y.
If the information about the occurrences of X and Y is given as shown in Table 4.
i. If only IDF is used for ranking which documents are considered to be most relevant for Q.
ii. Will the ranking be same if only TF is used why or why not?

Q5. Probabilistic IR, Evaluation of IR systems and CLIR
[0.5+0.5+2+1+7+5.5 = 16.5 Marks]
a) In Probabilistic IR terms not present in query are equally likely to occur in any document but do
not affect the retrieval process.
[True/False]
b) Stemming increases recall.
[True/False]
c) During Linguistic processing phase list 2 problems while dealing with CLIR with examples.
d) In the IBM models in language translation when will the probability of 0 be assigned to a
perfectly generated sentence and why?
e) Consider these word alignment examples shown in Table 5.

Table 5
How many phrase pairs can be extracted for each alignment? What do these examples suggest
for the relationship between number of alignment points and the number of extracted phrase
pairs?
f) Consider a scenario where you are asked to design a search engine for CLIR where the query
can be input in English or Hindi and retrieve documents of either language satisfying the
information need .The corpus consist of three different types of documents A, B and C where

A. English only documents
B. Hindi only documents
C. Documents for which there is both a Hindi and English version.
An example corpus is given in Table 6:
DocId Terms in the
DocId Terms in the
DocId

D3
मेरे घर
D1

5H
D4
D2
Open house
नमस्ते प्रोफेसर
5E

Terms

document

the

नमस्ते, और स्वागत

hello,
and
welcome
The following is a translation of the Hindi words above for your own information. This
glossary is NOT available to the IR system:
मेरे = my
घर = house
नमस्ते = hello
प्रोफेसर = professor
और = and
स्वागत = welcome
Table 6
Construct a single appropriate inverted index for the corpus consisting of the above documents
so that when the user queries the documents from both languages can be retrieved.
Q6. Recommender systems
[0.5+1=1.5 Marks]
a) Collaborative filtering assumes that if user had similar tastes in the past they will have similar
taste in the future.
[True/False]
b) In the matrix decomposition using SVD for Collaborative filtering the matrix U represent
_________________.
c) Let A be a 500X100 matrix and the number of concepts to which it has be mapped is 5.
i. What are the sizes (numbers of rows and columns) of U, Σ, and VT? [1.5+1+1=3.5 Marks]
ii. How many non-zeros elements can matrix Σ have at most considering that all the variances
are non-zero elements?
iii. Is matrix A invertible? Explain in one sentence why/why not.
Q7. Multimedia Information retrieval (MIR)
[2+3+2=7 Marks]
a) In an image retrieval system, what kind of features could be extracted from the images? How
can the retrieval be done if the query is an image or a text query? How can you combine the
results of retrieval based on images with the results of retrieval based on the text captions of
the images?
b) Consider the following 5X5 matrix in the first column of the Table 7 showing the color
encoding for an image and the color encoding scheme in the second column of Table 7, draw
1D histogram showing the color distributions in RGB.
