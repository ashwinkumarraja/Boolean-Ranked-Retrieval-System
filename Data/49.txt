Performance appraisal is a rigorous comprehensive process at Infosys, tied to the future development of the individual‘s skills and capabilities. First, an evaluation of personal skills is carried out for the tasks assigned to an individual during the appraisal period. The criteria used to evaluate performance on tasks are derived from the business goals and include: Adherence to schedule, quality of work, customer satisfaction, adherence to budget. The evaluation of personal skills and abilities is carried out for the following: learning and analytical ability, decision making, communication skills, teamwork, organizing skills. Each criterion is described and measured on a five points. Further, each of the scale points are anchored to descriptions of expected behavior. Performance appraisal is carried out in July and January. Appraisals are sought from peers, direct supervisors, subordinates and customers. A minimum of 6 to 7 appraisal reports are collected for each employee. All appraisal forms are completed on-line and the data is maintained in a central database. The appraisal information is used to identify training courses and other developmental interventions. Future objectives for both task accomplishment and individual skills development are based on the results of the evaluation. (12M)  1.1.

 Q3. Jennifer Carter graduated from State University in June 2003, and, after considering several job offers, decided to do what she really always planned to do—go into business with her father, Jack Carter. Jack Carter opened his first Laundromat in 1990 and now has six-store chain of cleaning centers. Each store had its own store manager and, on average, about seven employees that includes cleaner-spotters, presser, counter people and annual revenues of about $500,000. It was this that Jennifer joined upon graduating from State University.  Carter Cleaning Centers does not have a formal wage structure nor does it have rate ranges or use compensable factors. Wage rate are based mostly on those prevailing in the surrounding community and are tempered with an attempt on the part of Jack Carter to maintain some semblance of equity between what workers with different responsibilities in the stores are paid.  Needless to say, Carter doesnot make any formal surveys when determining what his company should pay. He peruses the want ads almost every day and conducts informal surveys among his friends in the local chapter of the laundry and cleaners trade association. While many of Jack colleagues adhere to a policy of paying absolutely minimum rates, Jack has always followed a policy of paying his employees about 10% above what he feels are the prevailing rates, a policy that he believes reduces turnover while fostering employee loyalty.   Jennifer believes that there should be skill (educational, technical skill) , responsibility(scope of control, impact of job) and effort (problem solving, task complexity)  as compensable factor with weightage 50, 30, 20 respectively. She believes in having maximum  3 degree for each compensable factors  and benchmark job as storage manager and presser. She feels quite strongly that point methods will be the right job evaluation methods with value not going beyond 250 points.  Market survey indicates that store manager on average gets $1000 and Presser $600 per month. (28M)   3.1. What are the three essential equities need to be considered while designing pay structure? Does that exist in the Carter cleaning company? Take inferences from the case to justify your choice. (5M) 3.2 How formal salary structure design can resolves these basic equity issues. (3M) 3.3. Plot wage curve based on the Jennifer’s assumption.  (10M) 3.4. How many pay grades will you suggest for Carter Company and who all will be under it. (2M) 3.5. A store manager’s job is to keep total wages to no more than 30% of sales and to maintain the fuel bill and the supply bill at about 9% of sales each. Managers can also directly affect sales by ensuring courteous customer service and by ensuring that the work is done properly.  What suggestions would you make to Jennifer and her father for an incentive plan for store managers?  .What incentive plan you think would work better for the pressers? (3+1M) 3.6. Suggest some benefit plan for Carter Company’s employees. (4M)
