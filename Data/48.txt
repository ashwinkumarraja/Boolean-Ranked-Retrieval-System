 1. British Gas is part of the Centrica Group. This is a multi-national company, operating in the UK and Europe and the UK’s largest energy supplier. British Gas Services (BGS) is the arm of the business that deals with installing and maintaining services, rather than gas supply. To deliver these services effectively, BGS needs the right staff, with the right skills.  Managers at British gas conduct a programme of forecasting to predict how much the UK market for domestic gas engineering services will grow. Managers at B.G. studys firms  past employment needs over a period of years to predict future needs. It involves extending past rate of change into the future. Managers find out the number of  engineers required to customer base. This helps the company decide how many additional engineers it will need in the future. B.G. makes detailed forecasts of its demand for engineering personnel for one year in advance and makes more general estimates for a further two years into the future. Even survey approach is used where estimates are solicited from groups of experts usually managers.  As part of its workforce planning, British Gas implements a diversity and inclusion strategy using tailored action plans. This means it actively seeks new recruits from a wide range of backgrounds. The need to recruit a diverse engineering workforce is seen as critical by British Gas. It plans recruitment to ensure it has a socially inclusive workforce. This is important as it will enable British Gas to reflect the diversity of its customer base. For example, it is useful to have employees from different nationalities and backgrounds to communicate with customers that do not speak English as a first language. Recruiting more women engineers may help to attract female customers. To dispel the myth that only men can be good engineers, British Gas runs a Georgina and the Dragon campaign. This has had some success. The British Gas Academy has won an award from Women into Science and Engineering as well as a national award from the Council for Registered Gas Installers (CORGI) for its efforts to encourage and attract women into the engineering workforce and into plumbing and associated trades. In May 2008 the recruitment team at British Gas was recognised by Opportunity Now, winning the prestigious award for 'Inspiring the workforce of the future'. British Gas tries to appeal to a varied and diverse audience when promoting its apprenticeships. To advertise opportunities widely, British Gas uses specialist Sky channels like Parliamentary Projects TV, which focuses on careers, and Passion TV, which is aimed at the black community. In print media, it uses women's magazines, publications targeted at ethnic minorities such as The Muslim Weekly as well as other careers directories for the same reason. Other channels include radio, newspapers, British Gas website (www.britishgasacademy.co.uk) and a DVD for schools Selection takes place at the BGS assessment centre and has three parts: an interview based on the online questionnaire ;role-play of customer service situations ;a manual dexterity test.
