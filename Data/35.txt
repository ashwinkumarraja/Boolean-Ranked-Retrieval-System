8. BHEL’s forte is coal based thermal power plants where its market share is 75%, 65% in nuclear and 50% in hydro based thermal power plants.  Do the SWOT analysis (4M)
NTPC is planning additional capacities to the tune of 2800 MW at a cost of Rs. 52 billion.  BHEL could benefit a lot as it has happened in the past that significant portion of the project of NTPC is handled by BHEL. Nearly 85% of the NTPC projects were assigned to BHEL only. Having PSU status is subject to rules and regulations and is forced to carry a huge amount of labor force, which it is not able to retrench. The business of modernization and renovations of power plants is expected to grow in India. The company is dependent on NTPC to a great extent. The company has 180 products under 30 major product groups that cater to the needs of the core sector like power, industry, transmission, telecommunications and oil business. Increase in defence budget will increase the topline for the company. The company is vertically integrated, which could have been avoided by outsourcing its components for power generation and transmission. This could have reduced the cost. The power sector reforms are expected to pick up in the near future in India. BHEL’s ability to acquire modern technology and make it suitable to Indian conditions has been exceptional.


















9. South West Airlines basic aim is to deliver low-cost, convenient service on short haul routes. One big way is by giving fast, 15 minute turnarounds at the gate, thus keeping planes flying longer hours than rivals. This need motivated ground crews, gate employees, and even pilots all pitch in and do whatever it takes to get planes turned around. The airline employs a fun and casual work environment. No formal hierarchy is enforced. It’s not uncommon to see the pilots assisting the flight stewards in helping them check the passengers in the plane or cleaning the plane. Thus airlines devotes enormous attention to the people it hires. On average, the company hires only 3% of the interviewed in a year. When hiring, it emphasizes team work, positive attitude, multi -tasking, people oriented, high customer responsiveness and willingness to pitch in.  Their philosophy is to treat their employees well and put them ahead of their customers. The benefits it gives it employees, include: profit-sharing and empowering employees to make decisions. The logic is if the employees are valued, they will treat the customers well and that will spread the reputation of the Airlines further. On average there are 94 employees per Southwest aircraft in contrast to competitors who have 130, and the Southwest staff serves on average 2500 passengers per year compared to competitors 1000. Keeping the workforce number minimal, they have cut off a major fraction of labor costs incurred generally by other carriers, whilst not letting any shortcoming come in smooth running of operations.  When the pilots of the other carriers are affiliated to Unions which have restricted working hours at for one period, Southwest Airlines pilots are not unionized under such regulations which allows them to work smoothly unhindered. 
Based on “Resource based view” approach, explain the role of HRM in contributing to sustained competitive advantage to South West Airlines. (8M)
