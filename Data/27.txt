Q3.Given the color histograms for the query and the three images named a, b and c with each
histogram having four colors: red, blue, purple, and yellow where the first bin shows number of
red pixels, second bin shows blue, third bin shows purple and fourth bin shows yellow. Compute
the partial histogram intersection and Canberra Distance and rank the images based on both the
distances.

Q4.Page Rank
[5 Marks]
Consider the following web pages and the set of web pages they link to
Page A points to pages B, C, and D.
Page B points to pages A and D.
Page C points to pages B and D.
Page D points to page A.
Trace the page rank algorithm for two iterations and fill Table 3. What is the order of the pages
after the two iterations? Use initial PR values 1 for all nodes use d=0.85.
Remember that one way to describe the algorithm is:
PR(A) = (1-d) + d(PR(T1)/L(T1) + … + PR(Tn)/L(Tn))
