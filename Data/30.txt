   i. Which documents match the phrase query “FOOLS RUSH IN” AND “ANGLES FEAR
      TO TREAD”?
  ii. There is something wrong with this positional index. What is the problem?

  e) Give the name of the index we need to use if                                  [2 Marks]
    i. We want to consider word order in the queries and the documents for a random number of
   words?
   ii. What kind of Index can we use if we assume that word order is only important for two
   consecutive terms?

 f) Given a two-word query. The postings list of one term consists of the following 16 entries:
     [4,6,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,32,47,81,120,122,157,180] and for the other it is the one entry
     postings list: [47].
     How many comparisons would be done to intersect the two postings lists with the following
     two strategies. Briefly justify your answers:                                   [1+2=3 Marks]
    i. Using standard postings lists
   ii. Using postings lists stored with skip pointers, with a skip length as discussed in the class.

Q2. Tolerant retrieval                                                           [4*3 = 12 Marks]
 a) Consider the following sentence silly billy sally sat on the hill
    i. What is the total number of bigram dictionary entries that will be generated by the above
       text? List the first five entries in the dictionary.
   ii. How would the wild-card query si*y be best expressed as an AND query using the bigram
       index you have constructed? Think about the most efficient query in terms of the number of
       posting entries traversed. For simplicity, answer by giving a list of bigrams ordered based
       on their postings list sizes (one line, space separated). For example, you should write ab cd
       ef to refer to the Boolean query ((ab AND cd) AND ef ).
  iii. How many posting entries are traversed for the most efficient query in question ii?
 b) What is soundex code for the following two names Robert and Rupert? If the alphabets are
     mapped to numbers as follows (B, F, P, V  1)(C, G, J, K, Q, S, X, Z  2 )(D,T  3)
        (L  4) (M, N  5) (R  6)                                                       [2 Marks]

   Consider a sample corpus consisting of three documents given below
   D1: Hindustan Hamara Hai
   D2: Hindustan Hamara jaiho
   D3: ye gulistaan hai
   Q: Hindustan Hindustan Hai
a) What are the similarity scores between the query(Q) with each document given above using
   Jaccard coefficient?
b) Compute the tf-idf score for each term in the document.
c) Compute the cosine score between and the query(Q) with each document using the tf-idf of
   the terms computed in question b and rank the documents. To compute the tf-idf of terms in
   the query consider the number of documents to be 1 and tf of each term.

   total of 20 relevant documents in the collection. Calculate the precision and recall of the
   system on this search?
b) Consider an information need for which there are 4 relevant documents in the collection.
   Two queries are run on this collection and their results are shown below
   Query1 R N R N N N N N R R
   Query2 N R N N R R R N N N
   Compute the Average Precision of each query and Mean Average Precision (MAP)?
c) If the MAP of one search engine is higher than the other what does it indicate? What does it
   say about what is important in getting a good MAP score?

Q6.Languages Models and CLIR                                               [4+2+6=12 Marks]
a) Consider the following sentence “SILLY SILLY SAT ON A WALL” assume a unigram
   language model and calculate the probability of generating this sentence. Assume that your
   machine can generate only these words and all words probability are equal.
