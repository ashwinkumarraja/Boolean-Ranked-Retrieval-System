Compensable factors and construction of degrees for each sub category is presented in table 1. Also job description indicated following characteristic to each of the benchmark jobs. (see table2).   Market survey was conducted with companies like Hyundai motors, Tata motors and Renault-Nissan for these benchmark jobs.  Market survey indicated that on average Salesperson gets Rs 50,000/-, Administrative Assistant Rs 60,000/-, Accountants 74,000/-, Engineers Rs 90,000/- and Managers Rs 94000/- per month respectively.

II. In a large-scale steel plant, the grievance procedure in operation specifies the subjects coming under the purview of the procedure. These include: amenities and services, compensation, fines, increment, leave, misconduct, discharge and dismissal, promotion, safety appliances, transfer, victimization and increment. The procedure provides for three stages through which grievances could be processed. In the first stage, the employee having a grievance is required to meet his supervisor/foreman and talk it over to him. If the worker is satisfied, the matter ends here. If he is not satisfied, he has to place his grievance in writing in the prescribed form to the supervisor/foreman who is required to give a written answer within 3 days. If the worker is still dissatisfied, he may place his grievance in writing before the head of the department concerned. The head of the department is required to discuss the issue with the employee and the supervisor/foreman concerned and send his reply within 3 days of the receipt of the complaint. If the worker is not satisfied with the outcome at this stage, he may appeal in writing to the zonal works committee within 15 days of the receipt of the complaint. Unanimous decision of the zonal works committee is final. If no unanimity is reached in the committee, the worker is free to make any constitutional measure open to him.
4. In what ways does the procedure in the steel plant differ from the model grievance procedure. In which of the stages are the union’s representatives involved in the deliberations?  What is the status of arbitration in the procedure? [5+3+2]
