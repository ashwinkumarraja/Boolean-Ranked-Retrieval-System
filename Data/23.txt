FIRST SEMESTER 2016 – 2017
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL (CS F469) TEST – 2 REGULAR
Date: 24.10.2016
Weightage: 20 %( 60 M)
Duration: 60min.
Type: Closed Book
Instructions: Answer all parts of the question together. Your answers should be brief.
Q1. Evaluation of IR systems
A. Consider two students issuing queries Q1 and Q2 and the following are the search results (the
documents are ranked in the given order; the relevant documents are shown in bold).
Q1: D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10
[2.5+4+3.5=10M]
Q2: D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10.
For Q1 and Q2 the total number of relevant documents are 4 and 5 respectively.
i. Compute the precision and recall at each rank for Q1.
ii. Draw the interpolated precision and recall curve for Q1.
iii. What is the Mean Average Precision(MAP) of the search engine?

B. In the context of ranked retrieval two search engines A and B claim the following [2.5+2.5=5 M]
Scenario – 1
Scenario – 2
System A obtains an average Precision of 0.50 System A obtains an average Precision of 0.50
at rank 10
at rank 1
System B obtains an average Precision of 0.10 System A obtains an average Precision of 0.20
at rank 10
at rank 20
As a user using the information in both scenarios which search engine you would prefer and why?
C.
Figure-1 depicts interpolated precisionrecall curves for two search engines that
index research articles. There is no
difference between the engines except in
how they score documents. Imagine you’re a
researcher looking for all published work on
some topic. You don’t want to miss any
citation. Which engine would you prefer and
why?
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk[3M]

D. You are hired as an information retrieval specialist for Bing which plans to utilize user clicks in
search evaluations. How would you improve the results returned by ranked retrieval using this
information?

Q2. Recommender Systems
A. A library has adequate ratings for its book collection and it plans to use a more advanced
recommendation system like the one used in Netflix prize. Suppose the mean ratings of the books
is 3.7 stars. Aman, a faithful customer, has rated 400 books and his average rating is 0.3 stars higher
than average users’ ratings. A book titled “Percy Jackson and the sea of monsters” in the library
has 225,000 ratings whose average rating is 0.7 higher than the global average. Compute the
baseline estimate of Aman for the title “Percy Jackson and the sea of monsters”?
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk[2M]

B. Given the following normalized utility matrix of user ratings for products answer questions i-iii
P1
P2
P3
P4
P5 P6
0.67
-2.33 1.67
Aman

Eshaan
Nidhi

-2.33 1.67 0.67

???

Maya

-2.6

-0.6

i. Who is the nearest neighbor of Nidhi to predict rating for product P4?
[3+2+3=8 M]
ii. Which recommender system would you prefer if you want to predict for Maya for P5 and why?
iii. What is the predicted rating for Nidhi with respect to Product P4 using User based collaborative
filtering with two neighbors? [note use the weighted version of the rating formula]
C. Let A be the matrix of size 500 users (rows) X100 movies (columns), using a Singular value
decomposition if they are mapped to 5 genres/concepts answer questions i-iv.
i. What are the sizes of matrices U, Σ and VT ?
[1.5+1.5+2+2=7 M]
ii. How many maximum number of non-zero elements can be there in the matrix Σ? What does
each value in the matrix Σ signify?
iii. After decomposing A into U, Σ, VT using SVD under what conditions is the matrix A invertible
(i.e we can get back original A using U, Σ, VT ) and how?
iv. After decomposing A you wish to retain only 3 genres how will you reduce the number of
dimensions and what will the size of U, Σ, VT after dimension reduction?
Q3. Machine Translation [Questions A – D must be answered assuming that we are translating
from Hindi to English]
A. In which phase of IBM Models is the parallel corpus used and why?
[3M]
B. Consider the following lexical translations from Hindi to English words.
[2+1+4+2 = 9M]
यह
घर
सुंदर
है
This – 0.8 house – 0.6
beautiful – 0.5
is - 1
The – 0.13 home – 0.2
pretty – 0.4
It – 0.04
dwelling – 0.1 lovely – 0.05
She - 0.02 mansion – 0.05 nice looking – 0.05
He – 0.01 building – 0.05
i. Compute P(e,a|f) for translating the sentence यह घर सुंदर है
ii. Is the value of P(e,a|f) for translating this sentence है घर सुंदर यह same as in question i.
iii. Using the unigram langauge model for P(E), find the best translation sentence when IBM
Model-1 is used. Use the following three setences as the corpus to compute P(E).
This house is beautiful
This house is pretty
Pretty is the house
iv. What type of language model P(E) should be used to generate meaningful sentences in english?
C. Given the following sentence pair in Hindi and English (बिल्ली चटाई पर िैठ गई, The cat sat on the
mat), if IBM Model – 2 is used for translation with le=6 and lf=5 with the following alignment
a=(1,1,4,3,5,2) using the two parameters t and a express p(e,a|f)?
[5 M]
D. Fill in the blanks to complete the mathematical model of IBM Model -3.
